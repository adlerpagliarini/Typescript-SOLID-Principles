The Liskov Substitution say "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."
Already implemeted at 2_OpenClosedToDo.js, when I used an Interface we ensure that the code will be open for extension and closed for modification
and we also ensure that the method getArea will accept any kind of shape that implements the Interface IShape or had extend from Shape class
